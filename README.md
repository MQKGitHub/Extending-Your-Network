## 🛡️ Extending Your Network

**Room:** Extending Your Network — TryHackMe (I will add web link)  
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Date:** *(20 April 2025)*  

### 🎯 Objective  
To understand how networking components like firewalls, VPNs, switches, and routers work together to expand and secure network infrastructure.

---

### 🗝️ Key Concepts  
- Port forwarding – Allows external access to internal services by mapping public IPs to local ports.  
- Firewalls – Used to allow or deny traffic based on IP, port, or protocol.  
- Stateful vs Stateless firewalls – Stateful monitors whole sessions; stateless just checks individual packets.  
- VPNs – Securely link remote networks over the Internet via encrypted tunnels.  
- Routers – Direct traffic between networks by finding the best route.  
- Layer 2 & 3 switches – Layer 2 sends data using MAC addresses; Layer 3 adds routing using IPs.  
- VLANs – Separate network segments for better control and security.

---

### 🛠️ Tools Used  
- TryHackMe Static Site Simulator — Used to test network paths and firewall rules.  

---

### ⚠️ Challenges Faced  
- Understanding how Layer 3 switches combine switching and routing took a bit of effort.  
- The visual simulator helped make the difference between devices clearer.  
- VLANs made more sense after seeing how they isolate traffic.

---

### 🧠 What I Learned  
- The role each networking device plays in expanding and protecting a network.  
- The difference between VPN technologies and firewall behaviours.  
- How VLANs and port forwarding improve security and access control.

---

### 🌐 Real-World Application:  
> Port forwarding is used to make internal services like home servers or CCTV systems accessible over the Internet.  
> VPNs securely link remote offices, and firewalls control what traffic is allowed in or out based on rules.

### 💭 Reflections:  
- The simulation part was really engaging and helped cement the concepts.  
- I now have a clearer understanding of how networks are extended and secured.  
- I won’t forget how VLANs can virtually separate networks even when devices are physically connected.
